  <p class="about-text">
  <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
  Along with pursuing a major in Aerospace Engineering I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science because of my interest in the branch.
  </p>

  <p class="about-text">
  <span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
  I like to code and enjoy modelling physics based problems especially in the field of fluid mechanics. I'm very keen on researching in meshfree particle methods, multiphase flows and turbulence modelling.
