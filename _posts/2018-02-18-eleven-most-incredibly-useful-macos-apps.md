Hi! Here is the list of __11 Incredibly Useful macOS Apps__ that I have curated and you should probably use them for enhancing your _macOS_ experience (or I can say it turns you into a superuser) and they are FREE! Yes, free as in free beer. I have been using them for a quite a while now, and I thought they would stand useful for you guys as well.<br>

Whether you have a _MacBook Pro_ or _Air_ or a _iMac_, these work great for all, unless you have not been using macOS and have installed _Windows_ or any other OS (boot camped). However, only a few of them are available for _Windows_ and _Ubuntu_ as well.<br>


The list is in no particular order, they all are equally great in their relative terms of usage.


<h3>1. Helium</h3>

One phrase: Picture in Picture (PIP), if you are aware of this then you would certainly know about this App before getting to the end of this statement, if are you not then don't worry, so this App provides a floating window on your Mac screen on which you can play your favourite video from the Internet, using a link or you can play video file content while simultaneously working on other Apps. It is developed by Jaden Geller, it was featured on Product Hunt and Business Insider!

<h3>2. Mounty</h3>

If you are using your NTFS formatted UBS pen drives interchangeably between _Windows_ and _macOS_, then you must use this tiny handy tool, basically, it re-mount write-protected NTFS volumes under _macOS_ in read-write mode. I guess, needless to say, more about it.
