This is my first post, I'm moving from my old blog to GitHub pages now. It has been very exciting since I started developing it, soon I'll add new posts here as well as some of my older ones too. Watch out this space for more!

PS: By the way yes the above picture is a reference to __Stranger Things!__ <br>So you have found an easter egg, that's pretty good! I really liked that little explorer in you, please continue with your quest...
