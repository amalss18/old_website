If you are having a *VoLTE* capable phone and yet you are not able to get *VoLTE* services on it. Just follow this simple concise guide to activate *VoLTE* on your device.<br>

In February of 2018, *Vodafone* launched *VoLTE* services in metropolitans and select cities in India, the enhanced service is available for free of cost but you just need to have a *VoLTE* capable device. If you have either *Prepaid* or *Postpaid* connections, this guide would work for both the type of connection. Follow these simple step for activation (please note, these steps are for *Android* users only, sorry *Apple* fans)

<h3>What You Will Get?</h3>
Notice the *VoLTE* icon on the status bar next to the 4G signal strength.

<h2>So Let's Get Started</h2>
<h3>From Within Your Phone Settings:</h3>

__Step 1__: Go to Settings.<br>
__Step 2__: Tap on Mobile networks.<br>
__Step 3__: Look for *VoLTE* option and turn on *VoLTE* Mode.

__NOTE:__ Also make sure that your device's firmware is up to date (including the one that should be able to turn on *VoLTE*.)

<h3>Hard Reset & Wipe:</h3>
Make sure your device is charged more than 60%.<br>

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__  This step would erase the data present on your phone, I would strongly recommend to make a backup of your personal data before proceeding. 


__Step 1__: Turn off your device.<br>
__Step 2__: Press and hold *Power* and *Volume Down* Button<br>
__NOTE:__ Other common button combinations are<br>
* Nexus devices - Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power
* Samsung devices - Volume Up, Home, and Power
* Moto devices - Volume Down and Power
* Other devices generally use Volume Down and Power. Some devices with physical user interfaces may use the Power and Home buttons.<br>

__Step 3__: When you are in *Recovery Menu*, look for *wipe data/factory reset*, use Volume keys to navigate and Power Key to select.<br>
__Step 4__: Similarly, look for *wipe cache partition*, after performing both wipes, Reboot phone. <br>

__NOTE:__ If *VoLTE* icon in the status bar is still not visible then probably *Vodafone* need to enable *VoLTE* for you from their backend, for that follow these steps:<br>
