__"The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvellous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day."__ - Albert Einstein

We all have at a point of life might have thought of a potential life exists in outer space, beyond far away stars, galaxies and in the known universe, there might be a chance that you have pondered and imagined all the possibilities to explore, you might have thought what exactly is out there millions of light years away, far enough that even our imagination would sometimes feel incapacitated, despite having limitless strength of our powerful cognitive ability.

Even Google wouldn't be able to quench your thirst for attaining the answers to the ultimate questions about life and everything, go ahead try to Google:<br> __<center>What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?</center>__ <br>You would surely be perplexed by what it is going to return, that's because you are asking a supercomputer to sum up all the things that are present around us, in the space and what we humans thrive to know about the deepest secrets of our universe and almost everything we have come across in life in a point of singularity. Now let's put things into a wider perspective, ready? below is an interactive app, use the slider to know on what level of perspective we are really considering here, experience from the smallest to the largest things possible in our cosmic horizon of space and time continuum.

If you really want to get amazed about the Universe then I would recommend you to watch this awesome video, titled __"The Known Universe"__, it takes viewers from the Himalayas through our atmosphere and the inky black of space to the afterglow of the Big Bang. Every star, planet, and quasar seen in the film is possible because of the world's most complete four-dimensional map of the universe, the Digital Universe Atlas that is maintained and updated by astrophysicists at the American Museum of Natural History. The new film, created by the Museum, is part of an exhibition, Visions of the Cosmos: From the Milky Ocean to an Evolving Universe, at the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan through May 2010.
